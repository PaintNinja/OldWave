v2.1
---
* Updated Wave logo to the new SVG-based logo that the v0.56 update brings
- Removed some redundent code
+ Improved performance
+ OpenSans is now used as the font on launch pages, rather than the broken old font which fell back to an ugly serif font. (OpenSans is locally hosted for better privacy, with specially optimized WOFF2/WOFF/TTF formats)

v2
---
+ Improved performance
* Fixed the broken favicon
+ You can now change the 128px icon shown next to the text on the left to the webapp's icon
+ The transparent box effect now also applys on basic launches
+ There are now templates to ease the creation of WebLaunch for new AppIDs
+ Themed WebLaunches can now use JXR with a JPG fallback for even better performance on IE
+ Themed web launches can now change the background colour
+ Changed the title so that future versions of Wave can close the WebLaunch once launched
+ Added a one second delay before launching the webapp so that the page loads as the webapp launches (UX improvement)
- Fully dropped support for IE8
* The viewport is now 1.0 instead of 0.7 to fix scaling issues on some browsers and devices

v1 - First version
